// erroring or cancelling a job causes all descendants to be cancelled and all parents to be errored/cancelled
// a child workflow returns a JobResult if disaptched, or just the workflow output, failing the parent if dispatchCheck is used
// completing a job causes the parent to be woken if it is sleeping, if that was that last child it was waiting on

meta should include workflow name and version, and other user defined properties
